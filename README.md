This project contains my solution to the Capture-The-Flag (CTF) challenge based on detecting a manipulated book within a large dataset of books and reviews. The objective of the challenge was to behave like an AI detective and uncover a secretly boosted book whose rating and reviews had been artificially altered. The assignment required identifying a hidden hash embedded in one of the reviews, confirming which book was manipulated, and then applying machine-learning-based authenticity analysis to complete the remaining flags.

The process began by generating a personal token from my student ID using SHA-256 hashing and taking the first eight hexadecimal characters. This token acts as a digital fingerprint planted inside a fake review. I merged the books and reviews datasets using the parent ASIN and searched through books with suspiciously perfect metrics—specifically those having a rating number of 1234 and an average rating of 5.0. I then scanned all their reviews to find the injected token. If the token was not present among the filtered candidates, I widened the search to the entire review corpus to locate the exact manipulated review. Once it was found, I extracted the book’s title field, processed its first eight non-space characters, and hashed them again using SHA-256 to produce FLAG1. FLAG2 was simply the discovered injected token wrapped in the required format.

To compute FLAG3, I analyzed the authenticity of all reviews belonging to the identified manipulated book. I engineered features such as TF-IDF text vectors, review length, and a superlative count (words like “best”, “perfect”, or tokens ending in “est”). Using these features, I trained a RandomForest classifier to distinguish suspicious reviews (short, 5-star, overly enthusiastic) from genuine, detailed ones. I then selected the reviews with the lowest predicted suspicion score and applied SHAP explainability to understand which words reduce suspicion the most. The top three negatively contributing words were concatenated with the numeric part of my ID and hashed again to produce FLAG3.

This repository includes my full solution code, all three flags, a reflection on the methodology, and a structured explanation of how each flag was derived.
